1. First initialize the repository on local computer - **git init**

2. Make new file and follow the above commands 3 and 4 

3. Before pushing it to github you have to create a connection between github and git easisest way to do that is to create a new repository with the same name on github - **git remote add origin git@github.com:username/filename.git**

4. To check which remote reposistories are added - **git remote -v**

5. Specify the git branch - **git branch -M main**

6. Now you can push the repo to github - **git push -u origin main** > (u is a shortcut to remember which branch to add the repo).
